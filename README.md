# **Fido - Watch Together**

Have you ever tried watching a movie together with your partner or friends while you’re miles apart?

You press play.  
They press play.  
Someone’s ahead. Someone’s behind.  
"Pause no, you pause."  
"Okay, now play, wait wait what time are you at?"  

What should feel shared slowly turns into coordination work.

**Fido** exists to fix that.

## The Idea

Fido is a real-time *watch-together* system built around a simple belief:

> **People don’t need perfect synchronization, they need shared experience.**

Instead of chaining fragile “play” and “pause” events across the network, Fido treats watching together as a **continuous convergence problem**. Every participant is always moving toward the same *desired state*:

> *“The video should be playing at 45.3 seconds.”*

If someone drifts ahead or falls behind, the system doesn’t snap, rewind, or stutter.
It gently nudges playback until everyone feels in sync again.

This is **perceptual synchronization** - keeping differences below what humans can actually notice (~200ms), rather than chasing mathematically perfect alignment that the internet can’t reliably provide.
